% This Matlab code generates a vector field for the system of ODEs 
% dx1/dt = f(x1,x2), dx2/dt = g(x1,x2)

% This code currently will find the vector field for the EXAMPLE problem
%           dx1 = -a*x1+b*x1.*x2;  
%           dx2 =  c*x2-d*x1.*x2; 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%        THESE ARE NOT THE PROBLEMS YOU ARE SOLVING FOR PROJECT 1!
% (To have this code generate the vector fields for the Project 1 systems 
% of equations, make any necessary adjustments in the sections of code 
% labeled with "Step i" where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Step 1: Set the axis limits so that you plot the vector field over the
%         intervals x1min < x1 < x1max, x2min < x2 < x2max
    x1min = -1; x1max = 6; x2min = -1; x2max = 6;

% Step 2: pick step sizes for x1 and x2;
    x1step = .2; x2step = .2; 

% generate mesh for plotting
    [x1, x2] = meshgrid(x1min:x1step:x1max, x2min:x2step:x2max);

% Step 3: define all needed parameter values 
    a = 1.5; b = 1.1; c = 2.5; d = 1.4;

% Step 4: define the system of equations you are using
    dx1 = -a*x1+b*x1.*x2;  
    dx2 =  c*x2-d*x1.*x2; 

% normalize vectors (to help plotting)
    dx1 = dx1./sqrt(dx1.^2 + dx2.^2); 
    dx2 = dx2./sqrt(dx1.^2 + dx2.^2); 

% generate the vector field
    quiver(x1, x2, dx1,dx2,'AutoScaleFactor',0.5)

% specify the plotting axes
    axis([x1min x1max x2min x2max])

% Step 5: label the axes, include a title

% The curves are out of phase, and this means that the interaction of the
% predator and prey depends on the population of each other. If the deer
% population is higher, it means the mountain lion population can rise
% because they have more food. As they kill off more deer, there is less
% food for them and their population goes down after the deer population
% decreases. Then, when the mountain lion population is low, the deer
% population can decrease because there are less predators to kill them,
% and the cycle repeats.
